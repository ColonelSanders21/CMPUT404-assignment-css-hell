                I am a 22 year old student working towards my BSc with Specialization in Computing Science at the University of Alberta.
                I love all things technology and pop culture, and am always excited to work on something new. In my spare time I enjoy 
                video editing and working on some hobby development projects, as well as the standard movies, TV, and video games.
