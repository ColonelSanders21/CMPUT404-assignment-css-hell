Modifications to Gutenberg files
===========================

I have commented out the existing <style> tags found in the Project Guternberg files, and have inserted the following line:
```
<!-- Link to my CSS page --> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```
The HTML files are otherwise untouched.
